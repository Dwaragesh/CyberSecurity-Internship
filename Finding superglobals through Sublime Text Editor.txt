1. Use find to find a parameter (_GET, _POST, _REQUEST)

2. Starting will tell you number of total files

3. End tells you how many gets, posts, etc. you have in certain amount of files out of the total files (very low because up most 95% of it cannot be found)

// look at applications that are given by Professor, find sinks and sources (_GET, _POST, _REQUEST) etc.
// look at the Documentation of Smarty
// look at how to install sublime text for free (requires license for some reason)
